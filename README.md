JDI Developer Task
==================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Get a github account (If you don't already have one)
- Install git, if you havenâ€™t used git before see;
 - <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>
 - <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>
- Fork <https://github.com/justdevelopit/php-fms-test>
- Clone your repository
 - This is where you will document your progress and commit the project
- Install PHP 5.3 or greater (PHP 5.4 is preferred)
 - Alternatively create a virtual machine using Vagrant (<http://www.vagrantup.com/>) and PuPHPet (<https://puphpet.com/>)

Task
----

You will be creating a "File Management System".

You may use a storage engine of your choice, for example MySQL, Sqlite or flat files. If you choose to use MySQL or another SQL database then please provide a schema dump.

Your git repository has three interfaces, please use these interfaces as the foundation of the task.

You may complete the task in any way you see fit, the resulting system can be either web or CLI based.

Please **do not** use any third party frameworks.

We would suggest that you use git commits in a way that allows the reviewer to understand the thought process taken to achieve each given goal. Branching models are not required but can be utilised if you like, at the very least wrapping each feature into a commit is recommended.

Conclusion
----------

In your repository *PROGRESS* file, you should note your experience with the task, and provide some critique to the codebase as a whole.

If you used Vagrant and/or PuPHPet to create a development VM please include the configuration files so we can test your code on the same platform.
